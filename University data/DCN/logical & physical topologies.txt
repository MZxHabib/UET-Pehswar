Physical topology: Imagine a neighborhood with houses. Physical topology is like how the houses are physically arranged and connected to 
each other, such as whether they're on the same street or connected by different roads. It's about how the houses are physically laid out.

Logical topology: Now, think about how people in those houses talk to each other. Logical topology is like the rules they follow when 
they communicate. It's about how they pass messages or information to each other, regardless of where the houses are or how they're 
connected physically. So, physical topology is about how things are physically connected, like the layout of the houses and the roads 
between them. Logical topology is about how information flows and how devices communicate, like the rules or patterns that govern the
communication between the devices.
