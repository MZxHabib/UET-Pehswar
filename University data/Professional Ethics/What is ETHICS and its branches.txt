What is ETHICS?
Ethics is a branch of philosophy that deals with questions about what is morally right and wrong, good and bad, just and unjust. It 
involves the study of moral principles, values, and judgments that guide human behavior and interactions. Ethics seeks to provide 
frameworks for determining how individuals and groups ought to behave, as well as evaluating the consequences of their actions. 

3 Branches of Ethics

1.Metaphysics: Think of metaethics as asking really deep questions about ethics. It's like wondering where our ideas about right and wrong come from. Metaethics doesn't focus on what's right or wrong in specific situations, but it tries to understand the big picture behind our moral beliefs. For example, it might ask, "What does it mean for something to be 'good' or 'bad'?" or "Are moral rules absolute or do they change?"

2.Normative Ethics: Imagine you're trying to figure out what's right and what's wrong. Normative ethics is like having a set of rules or criteria for deciding what actions are good or bad. It's about setting standards or guidelines for how we should behave in different situations. For example, it might say that helping someone in need is good, while hurting someone for no reason is bad. It's all about figuring out the right way to act based on these rules or standards.

In simpler terms:
- Metaphysics is about asking big questions about the nature of reality.
- Normative Ethics is about setting rules or standards for what's morally right or wrong.
